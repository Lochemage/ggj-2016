Diversifiers we are using:
------------------------------------

## Where in the world is… ##
Gameplay or art changes depending on the player's geographical location (GPS, IP location, etc). The game experience is therefore significantly different for players all around the globe - Art, Content, Design, Pervasive
- Uses google image search for finding source images, which can change based on your location.

## Crowd sourced ##
Anyone who is watching it can play along! - Design
- Open your browser and point to the server, you are now an instant player grouped with everyone else.

## Gandhi’s Game ##
This game must have zero violence in its game play. Conflicts must have resolutions based on logic  - Design, Theme
- Drawing game. No violence here.

## No retreat, no surrender ##
The protagonist is unable to go anywhere but forward, in every situation  - Art, Content, Design, Theme
- You have a time limit to draw, you can not cancel or go back to an earlier game session.

Diversifiers we may consider:
------------------------------------

## One hand tied behind my back ##
Create a game that can be played with only one hand. On mobile just one hand holding and playing at the same time i.e. just play with your thumb. Desktop, mouse only or keyboard only  - Accessibility, Design, Serious
- Only need a mouse with a single button.
- We'll have to do something about the 'type your name' field, perhaps a random button.

## Infinite ##
Your world is procedurally generated  - Code, Content
- A single draw session may branch out forever

## Comic book colours ##
Your game uses only 4 colours, with an emphasis on contrast  - Accessibility, Art, Design, Pervasive
- Maybe, do black and white count as two colors already?

## LEGO Got It Right ##
There are no spoken or written words in this game. This is even true in the instructions  - Pervasive, Accessibility
- Instructions are really simple, "Draw this image", "Choose the one that looks the most like yours", "Choose the one you think was the original". It may be possible to portray these instructions without words?
