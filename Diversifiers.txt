Diversifiers we may consider:
------------------------------------

## One hand tied behind my back ##

- Only need a mouse with a single button.
- We'll have to do something about the 'type your name' field, perhaps a random button.

## Infinite ##
Your world is procedurally generated  - Code, Content
- A single draw session may branch out forever
